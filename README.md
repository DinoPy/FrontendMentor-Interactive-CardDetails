### What I learned

How to fill svgs using the linear-gradint tag that allow defining a gradient in file.
How to conditionally push error to inputs based on patterns.

### Useful resources

The requirements for inputs are done with pattern attribute for inputs and custom validation message. I have used the following resources
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10361460/how-can-i-change-or-remove-html5-form-validation-default-error-messages
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_validation_api.asp
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState

For linearGradient tag I have used multiple sources however one that covers it all is
